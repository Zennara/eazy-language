# Eazy Language
 A simple programming language written and inspired by Python with a base on being easy to understand by non-programmers. Eazy's syntax is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a focus on basic programming concepts. While it currently has limited functionality, it has the potential to be expanded and improved over time.
 
 
# Here are some key features of Eazy's syntax:

## String Literals 
Strings in Eazy are surrounded by double quotes.
## Variable Declaration 
You can store values in variables using the `save` keyword, followed by the variable name, the `as` keyword, and the value (which can be a string, number, or another variable). For example, `save variable_name as "some string"` or `save variable_name as 42`.
## Console Output
You can display values to the console using the `display` keyword, followed by the value (which can be a string, number, or another variable). For example, `display "hello world"` or `display variable_name`.
## User input
You can prompt the user for input using the `input` keyword after the `as` keyword in variable declaration. For example, `save x as input` will prompt the user to enter a value and store it in the variable x.
## Loops
Loops are created using the `repeat` keyword, followed by the number of times to repeat (or the keyword `forever`), and then the code to repeat. For example, `repeat 5 times`, followed by the code to repeat, and then `end repeat`. Nested loops are still under development.
## Arithmetic
Eazy supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which can be used in statements or upon variable declaration. For example, `save variable_name as 2+2` or `display 10/2`.
